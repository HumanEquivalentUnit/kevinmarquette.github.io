As a system admin, I often find myself working very closely with SQL server. Here is a collection of resources that I find myself turning to over and over.

## SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) is an integrated environment for accessing, configuring, managing, administering, and developing all components of SQL Server. SSMS combines a broad group of graphical tools with a number of rich script editors to provide developers and administrators of all skill levels access to SQL Server. This release features improved compatibility with previous versions of SQL Server, a stand-alone web installer, and toast notifications within SSMS when new releases become available.

## How to license SQL Server
SQL Server licensing makes choosing the right edition simple and economical. Unlike other major vendors, there’s no having to pay for expensive add-ons to run your most demanding applications—because every feature and capability is already built in.

## sp_Blitz – Free SQL Server Health Check Script

You’ve got a Microsoft SQL Server that somebody else built, or that other people have made changes to over the years, and you’re not exactly sure what kind of shape it’s in. Are there dangerous configuration settings that are causing slow performance or unreliability?
You want a fast, easy, free health check that flags common issues in seconds, and for each warning, gives you a link to a web page with more in-depth advice.
