I have been a member of multiple user groups in the past for most of my carrier.  When I relocated to Orange County, CA a little over a year ago, I was a little surprised that we did not have a local PowerShell user group. I sat on the idea for a few months and then started the SoCal PowerShell user group of my own. I am really glad that I did.

I am always willing to talk about my experience and I often get a chance to connect with other people that are looking to do the same thing. I'm getting ready to have that conversation again with someone else that is looking to start a group. This time, I am also going to share that advice with you.

# What makes a good user group?

I have been to a lot of user groups over the years. Every one of them does things a little bit differently. If you are planning on running a user group, it would be a good idea to get out and attend a few other user groups. Not only do you get to see how other groups are ran but you also get to make some connections that will help later. Here are some things that I have learned from other groups.

## Regular schedule

I find that having a regular and consistent schedule makes it easier for everyone to plan on attending the group. I love to use a set weekday and week of the month. My group meets the first Tuesday of the month. This makes it easy for people to remember and plan for the event before they even look at your schedule. I think this also creates a built-in reminder. When one month comes to an end, that reminds me that I have a user group soon.

It is also important to commit to that schedule. If your users know that your group will meet every month it just makes it that much easier on them. Try to get your speakers/topics on the schedule 2-6 months in advance when you can.

If you are someone that waits until the last minute, know that your deadline to announce a speaker/topic is the user group meeting before that meeting. As a group member, I don't want to spend the month trying to figure out if the group is actually going to meet. I always close out my meeting by reminding the group and talking about the next topic.

As a speaker, I also like that extra time to work on my presentation. I have a few talks that don't need much work but I have others that are always in a state of revision.

## Finding speakers

I find one of the harder parts about running a user group is finding the right balance of speakers. 

There are a lot of people in the PowerShell community that are willing to remotely present to user groups.
