I was about to create a new module and decided that I was going to script out the process this time. Most of my stuff is very cookie cutter between modules. A lot of my standard stuff is duplicated across my modules.

David just covered the use of Plaster and it is exactly what I need for this. I am going to build on his post so you really should go read it first.

This also builds on my previous post about building a CI/CD pipeline.
