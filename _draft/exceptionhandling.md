Error handling is just part of live when it comes to writing code. We can check and validate conditions on expected behavior. When the unexpected happens, we turn to exception handling. You can easily handle exceptions generated by other people's code or you can generate your own exceptions for others to handle.

# Basic terminology
If you have not worked with exceptions before, there are some specific terms that you need to know.

## Exception

An Exception is an event that is generally created when normal error handling can not deal with the issue. Trying to divide a number by zero or open a file that does not exist are examples of something that will create an exception.

## Throw and Catch

When an exception event happens, we call that throwing an exception. To handle a thrown exception, you need to catch it. If an exception is thrown and it is not caught by something, the program will crash.

## Terminating and non-terminating errors

An exception is a terminating error. A thrown error will either be caught or it will exit the current execution. A non-terminating error is generated by `Write-Error` and it adds an error to the output stream without throwing an exception.
