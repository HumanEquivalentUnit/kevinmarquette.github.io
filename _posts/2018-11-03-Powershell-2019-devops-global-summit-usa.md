The [PowerShell and DevOps Global Summit 2019](https://powershell.org/summit) is one of the largest gatherings of the [PowerShell community](https://twitter.com/hashtag/PSHSummit?src=hash&lang=en). Not only is this conference packed full of sessions, it also gives you a chance to connect with many people from the community. This is a conference that has something for everyone.<!--more--> If you are just getting started with PowerShell, this year the Summit is offering an [OnRamp track](https://powershell.org/summit/summit-onramp/).

    Dates: April 29 - May 2, 2019
    Location: Bellevue, WA, USA

The Summit has a great lineup of [speakers and sessions](https://app.socio.events/MjQ4Nw/Speakers/14446) again this year. I see lots of sessions that I am eager to attend. I look forward to reconnecting with everyone I met last year. I also enjoy meeting with everyone else from the community and the readers of my content.

# My Sessions

This year I have 2 sessions on the schedule:

* [Publishing and Managing Modules in an Internal Repository](https://app.socio.events/MjQ4Nw/agenda/14445/session/61498)

> Setting up and publishing to an internal repository is much easier than most people expect. In this talk, I plan on covering why it's a good idea to use an internal repository to distribute modules. I will show how to publish modules to both a file share and a local nuget instance. The demo will show the user how to manually publish the module with the idea that it should be part of a CI/CD pipeline. We will address the idea of re-hosting public modules from the [PSGallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/) as a way to gate them into your organization. We will also show how to bootstrap other systems to use the internal repository.

* [Working with PSGraph](https://app.socio.events/MjQ4Nw/agenda/14445/session/61481)

> [PSGraph](/2017-01-30-Powershell-PSGraph/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=blog&utm_content=summi2019) is a module that was implemented as a DSL (Domain Specific Language) to make it easy to build node/edge based graphs in PowerShell. This module really acts as a wrapper around the open source GraphViz engine. I will introduce the GraphViz engine, show how the PSGraph DSL implements the features of GraphViz and then dynamically generate graphs. Examples in this talk include generating a organizational chart from a simple data set, dynamically generating an infrastructure diagram that even indicates up/down status of individual nodes, and mapping out system processes to remote network connections.

# See you in April

If you make it out to the Summit, feel free to say hello if you see me. I look just like my avatar so I am easy to spot. I was very honored meeting so many of my readers last year that just wanted to say thank you. I do appreciate it. My content has helped the community so much more than I ever expected that it would. Thank you.
