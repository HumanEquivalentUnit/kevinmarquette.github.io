If you have a few minutes, I would like you to check out [The PowerShell News Podcast](https://powershellnews.podbean.com/). The Podcast is hosted by two Microsoft MVPs, [Mick Pletcher](https://twitter.com/mick_pletcher) and [Harjit Dhaliwal](https://twitter.com/Hoorge). They have several episodes posted that cover a good range of PowerShell topics.

I met with Mick in person on his travels back from the MVP Summit and we connected with Harjit remotely for their latest episode, [Episode 6 - Interview with Kevin Marquette from the SoCal PowerShell User Group](https://powershellnews.podbean.com/e/interview-with-kevin-marquette-from-the-socal-powershell-user-group/). We talked about the [SoCal PowerShell User Group](http://socalpowershell.org/), the great team that I work with at loanDepot, and a bit about my contributions to the PowerShell community.

I look forward to listening to their future episodes and connecting with them again in the future.
